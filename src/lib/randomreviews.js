			' The selection of books is amazing, I really enjoy being able to sit at my computer and browse the books. I have ordered many books from Thrift Books and there has only been one book that was not in acceptable condition. Had it not been for that one book which I ended up throwing out, I would have given it 5 stars. Will continue to order from them.',

			'Great selection and prices. I love that if you view a book you have already bought, it will say you bought this title on XX date. Free shipping with only a $10 order, and you get credits toward a free book with every purchase. Also, responsive customer service if you do have any shipping problems.',
